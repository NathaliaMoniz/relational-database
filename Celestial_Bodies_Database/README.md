# FreeCodeCamp Database Challenge: Celestial Bodies Database

## Description

This repository contains the code and data structure for a project based on the FreeCodeCamp database challenge. The project involves creating and managing a database system for handling information about planets, moons, asteroids, and galaxies. The goal is to simulate a simple yet efficient relational database system where various celestial objects and their attributes can be stored, queried, and managed.

### Database Design
The database consists of several tables to store different types of astronomical data. The key tables include:

1. **Planets**: Information about planets in our solar system and exoplanets.
2. **Moons**: Details about the moons of planets, including characteristics like water presence and composition.
3. **Asteroids**: Data about various asteroids, including their size and other characteristics.
4. **Galaxies**: Information about different galaxies, their sizes, ages, and shapes.
5. **Stars**: Data on different stars, their masses, colors, and associated galaxies.

Each table has relevant fields to describe the attributes of these objects, and the relationships between them are established via foreign keys.

## Purpose

The project serves as a challenge to implement a simple database structure using SQL. The purpose is to practice and demonstrate skills related to:

- Database design and normalization.
- SQL queries to manipulate and retrieve data.
- Managing relationships between different entities in a database.

### Technologies Used

- **PostgreSQL**: The relational database management system (RDBMS) used for creating and managing the database.
- **SQL**: Structured Query Language for creating tables, inserting data, and querying the database.
